A logo is often the first form of communication a company has with their customers. When done right, a good logo effectively embodies the company as a whole, conveying each element of its brand identity, ethos and purpose. In this piece, we identify what makes a good logo design and which features are most regularly used in the logos of the world's largest 250 companies.
We analysed the logos of the 250 top companies on the Forbes 2000 list to discover which colors, styles and typographies are most commonly used. This analysis enabled us to discover which types of logo designs are used the most and which are the most effective*.
*In this article, we've referred to elements of logos that appear most frequently within the top 250 companies in Forbes' 2000 list as being the most effective. However, it's important to note that just because these elements are used most frequently in the logos featured in this list, this does not necessarily connote efficacy, as each company's success is a consequence of far more than just its logo.
The majority of logos use a mixture of two colors, with 108 of the 250 adhering to this type of colored logo design. Examples of companies that use a combination of colors within their logos are FedEx, with its iconic purple and orange font, as well as Vodafone, with its red and white brand logo.
96 of the 250 companies use only one color, emphasizing the popularity and effectiveness of simplicity in brand logos. The single color choice includes some of the world's most successful companies, such as Apple, National Grid and Samsung, who use just one color in their logo, creating a straightforward, memorable icon for their target consumers. Ultimately, branding statistics show that color improves brand recognition, something which is aided by the use of as few colors as possible. Companies looking to develop strong brand awareness would be wise to ensure that logo colors remain uniform across as many channels as possible, from physical signage and TV advertisements to online ads and social media marketing campaigns.
There are many styles of logos present in the Forbes 250 largest companies list. The most popular of these is the combination mark, which incorporates both text and a picture logo. Our analysis found that 152 of the 250 logo designs examined use this style, with examples including the logos of Mitsubishi, Costco and the Bank of China. Wordmark logos are also popular, used by 58 companies on the list including Samsung, Sony, Nestlé and IBM.
Even though pictorials and emblems aren't the most popular logo designs amongst the top 250 companies, they are employed by some of the most recognizable brands in the world. These include the Apple logo and the Nike "swoosh".
The most popular font style was Sans Serif, with 179 of the 250 largest global public companies utilizing it in their logo branding. This may be due to San Serif's popularity in various sectors, instilling a sense of familiarity amongst potential customers, who may feel more at ease when presented with typography of this kind.
Logos utilizing the Sans Serif font style include Unilever, Nestlé and Hyundai Motor. Although in the minority, the Forbes 250 companies who use the Serif typeface style in their logos include globally recognised brands like IBM, Aviva and Barclays.
So now we know more about what makes a logo successful. But what does the general population think when it comes to logos? Are people more likely to trust a brand if they recognise a logo? To find out, we surveyed 2,000 adults in June 2021 asking them to select which of the follow statements were true for them:
Our survey found that 26% of adults are more likely to trust a business if its branding or logo is familiar to them, and as we know, consumer trust is one of the most integral parts of building a successful brand.
Well, our survey revealed that 1 in every 4 adults (25%) are more likely to buy from a business whose branding or logo is familiar to them.
Our research found that 66.8% (or just over 2/3) of the logos representing the top 250 companies are asymmetrical, indicating a preference for this element of design. These results directly oppose the commonly held 'golden rule' of design that outlines a preference for symmetry amongst the public. One such explanation of this preference for asymmetry is that businesses have evolved beyond the best design practices to stand out from the competition, utilizing their company logo to communicate a new and exciting brand identity.
while not a part of the Forbes list measured in our study, the logo of Baskin-Robbins also presents a great example of this logo trend in action. Long famous for their 31 flavors, the current Baskin-Robbins logo features the number 31 accented in pink within the letters 'BR'. This type of branding strategy helps set businesses apart from their competitors and creates a sense of discovery for engaged consumers by hiding brand identity elements within the logo design.
Our above survey found that 45% of adults often recognise the logos of big brands and a further 35% often recognise the logos of brands they like. So which brand logos are the most recognizable?
The color blue appears the most in the world’s largest 250 companies’ logos, with almost a third (30.8%) of them having blue logos of some kind.

The least easily influenced age groups when it comes to brand logos are those aged 45-54 and 55+, as fewer people in this age group say that a brand’s logo impacts their likelihood of trusting or purchasing from them.

An excellent example of how technology can affect logo design in US news channel CBS. The introduction of color TV in the 60ties led to CBS changing their black and white eye logo to a more colorful version.

We take a look at the most prominent logo statistics of 2021 to evaluate what that means for logo design going forward in 2022.
We've talked extensively about colour semiotics before, and it's for good reason. Research from Website Planet found that in 2021, 40% of Fortune 500 companies are using the colour blue in their logo.
Website Planet went one step further though and deduced that the colour of a logo makes up to 90% of a consumer’s first impression about the brand identity. That's a significant stat, and it's one to be aware of in 2022.
After the mass of just blue logos, the most popular number of colours in Fortune 500 companies is two (43% of companies). 37% are one colour, whilst some brave hearts have a mix of 3 (14%) and four (5%) respectively.
However, the top colours used by brands in their logo designs are blue (35%), red (30%) and grayscale (23%).
As we move into 2022 however we'd expect to see some more dynamic logos appear, which is good news for fans of colour.
Gradients are now incorporated in the logos of 34 Fortune 500 companies, and are proving to be a popular modern logo trend used by major brands like Chevron, Ford and UPS.
The rise of gradients is thanks to businesses with a strong brand. They're able to change their iconic logo designs to support cultural issues, without losing customers. Apple were the first to do it way back in 1977 when they changed their greyscale Apple logo to rainbow colours in order to support the Pride movement. In 2020, a number of Premier League clubs added blue where possible to their logos to support the NHS throughout the Coronavirus pandemic, whilst LinkedIn also replaced its corporate blue in favour of a gradient rainbow to support LGBTQ+ month.
To prove it, research by Renderforest discovered that logos are the most identifiable brand recognition symbols - stated by 75% of consumers. Visual style closely followed at 60%, whilst brand colour came in at 45%. Unique voice came bottom of the pack with only 25% stating they could identify a brand by its brand voice.
We're sure we don't need to tell you why this is so important as the calendar changes into 2022, but just in case: two years previously in 2020, 50% of consumers attested to being more likely to patronise a brand with a logo that they recognise.
That means that if brand awareness and customer acquisition are top of your business objective list in 2022, your business logo design needs to be authentic, reflective of the brand image, and also memorable enough for customers to recognise it wherever they go - just like the iconic coca cola logo.
Sans serif fonts are used by over three-quarters of Fortune 500 businesses. Furthermore, 90 logos, or 18%, use only serif fonts, whereas 32 logos, or 6%, mix sans serif and serif typefaces. Only 2% of companies on the Fortune 500 list utilise some other font style, such as handwritten or script.
All caps is the most popular type of font when it comes to business logos (47%). Another 33% prefer the title case, and another 12% utilise all four. However, you don't always need to adhere to popular trends.
The capitalisation and typeface size of your brand logo are determined by a variety of factors, including brand identity, font selection, and the length of the business name. Only 7% of the world's top firms, such as Mastercard and eBay, use lowercase logos. The majority of companies at the top of their industries (for example: Microsoft, IBM) are uppercase.
Clothes retailer Gap decided to rebrand their logo, but it got such a hated response from their customers that they were forced to u-turn in just 6 days at the cost of $150 million.
Mastercard also ran into uproar in 2006 when they went wild on what looked like vector graphics software and added a plethora of clunky elements to their classic and minimalistic logo. Just like Gap, customers hated it and the design damaged the brand's image and cost them $1.5 million.
What's this got to do with 2022 logo statistics you ask? It's something to be aware of because 74% of companies in 7 years is a big number. Especially when those companies likely need a brand refresh and not a rebrand.
Take for example two successful logo design refreshes. Social media giant Instagram changed their 3D Polaroid camera to the original camera outline and added a gradient. Because they kept the initial element users came to love - the eye-catching Polaroid design the refresh boosted their brand awareness and was praised for its sleek, modern concept.
Likewise, FedEx wanted to overhaul their industrial appearance but keep their famous logo. Their latest, flattest and modernised version worked: it resulted in a 20% increase in sales.
The objective of our latest research was to assist managers with such a choice. To explore whether and when brands benefit more from descriptive or nondescriptive logos, we conducted seven experimental studies and analyzed the effect of logo design on brand equity for 597 companies. If you have not guessed it yet, the logo on the right is what we consider descriptive, and the logo on the left is what we consider nondescriptive.
The question of whether to use a descriptive logo or a nondescriptive logo often arises during design meetings. In recent years several brands have modified their logos to make them more descriptive, while others have made their logos nondescriptive. Dunkin’ removed the word “donuts” and the coffee cup from its logo, making it nondescriptive. Conversely, Animal Planet made its logo even more descriptive by adding an elephant to the design. In our analysis, we found that about 60% of companies used a nondescriptive logo, while 40% used a descriptive logo.
In another study, we analyzed a data set on 423 business-to-consumer brands. To create this data set, we acquired each brand’s financial information (such as net sales, advertising and R&D spending, and total assets). We then obtained their logos and asked research assistants — who did not know the purpose of our study — to code whether these logos were descriptive or nondescriptive, as well as 13 other design characteristics of the logos (such as symmetry, shape, color). Using a regression analysis, we explored the effect on net sales of having a descriptive or nondescriptive logo. The financial information we gathered and the 13 logo design characteristics served as control variables. The results showed that a descriptive logo has a greater positive effect on sales than a nondescriptive one.
When we tested our findings on the logos of 174 early-stage startups, they held true. We presented their logos and product descriptions to 2,630 individuals and found that descriptive logos were more often associated with a higher willingness to buy.
